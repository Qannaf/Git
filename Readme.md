# 1. Getting started with Git
## 1.1. Create your first repository, then add and commit files
* See if we have git installed
````
git --version
git status
````
* Intialize git 
````
git init
````
* Add commit
````````
git add <file1> <file2> < ... >
git add commit -m"message or v0.0.0.1 beta"
````````
for add all file
```
git add .             
```
* Upload to github
```
git remote add origin <https://your-git-service-address>/owner/repository.git>
git push -u origin main
```

## 1.2. Clone a repository
````
git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git  
			or 
git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git MyFolder
````

## 1.3. Setting your user name and email
* Add a global identity
````
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email mail@example.com
````

* Remove a global identity
````
git config --global --remove-section user.name
git config --global --remove-section user.email
````
## 1.4.Learning about a command
* Help
````
git diff --help
git help diff            
git diff -h       If you only want a quick help showing you
````

# 2. Browsing the history
## 2.1. "Regular" Git Log
````
git log
git log -2         If you wish to limit your command to last n commits log
````
## 2.2. Prettier log
````
git log --decorate --oneline --graph
````
## 2.3. Oneline log
````
git log --oneline
git log -2 --oneline
````
## 2.4. Log search
````
git log -S"Hello Qannaf"      	Searches for addition or removal
git log -S"Hello Qannaf"	Searches for changes in lines containing
````
## 2.5. List all contributions grouped by author name
````
git shortlog
````
## 2.6. Searching commit string in git log
````
git log --all --grep "removed file"		Will search for removed file string in all logs in all branches.
git log --grep="add file" --invert-grep
````
## 2.7. Log for a range of lines within a file
````
git log -L 1,20:main.cpp
````
## 2.8. Filter logs
````
git log --after '3 days ago'
git log --after 2021-04-03
git log --author=Qannaf 
````
## 2.9. Log with changes inline
````
git log --patch		or		git log --p
````
## 2.10. Log showing commited files
````
git log --stat
````
## 2.11. Show the contents of a single commit
````
git show 6531d54
````
## 2.12. Git Log Between Two Branches
````
git log master..foo 
``````
will show the commits that are on foo and not on master. Helpful for seeing what commits
					you've added since branching!


# 3. Working with Remotes
## 3.1. Deleting a Remote Branch
To delete a remote branch in Git:
````
git push [remote-name] --delete [branch-name]
or
git push [remote-name] :[branch-name]
````
## 3.2. Changing Git Remote URL
* Check existing remote
````
git remote -v
# origin https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
# origin https://github.com/usernam/repo.git (push)
````
* Changing repository URL
````
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo2.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL
````
* Verify new remote URL
````
git remote -v
# origin https://github.com/username/repo2.git (fetch)
# origin https://github.com/username/repo2.git (push)
````
## 3.3. List Existing Remotes
* List all the existing remotes associated with this repository:
````
git remote
````
* List all the existing remotes associated with this repository in detail including the fetch and push URLs:
````
git remote --verbose
	or simply
git remote -v
````








## 3.4: Removing Local Copies of Deleted Remote Branches
If a remote branch has been deleted, your local repository has to be told to prune the reference to it.
To prune deleted branches from a specific remote:
```
git fetch [remote-name] --prune
```
To prune deleted branches from all remotes:
```
git fetch --all --prune
```

## 3.5: Updating from Upstream Repository
Assuming you set the upstream (as in the "setting an upstream repository")
```
git fetch remote-name
git merge remote-name/branch-name
```
The pull command combines a fetch and a merge.
```
git pull
```
The pull with --rebase flag command combines a fetch and a rebase instead of merge.
```
git pull --rebase remote-name branch-name
```

## 3.6: ls-remote
git ls-remote is one unique command allowing you to query a remote repo without having to clone/fetch it first.
It will list refs/heads and refs/tags of said remote repo.
You will see sometimes refs/tags/v0.1.6 and refs/tags/v0.1.6^{}: the ^{} to list the dereferenced annotated
tag (ie the commit that tag is pointing to)
Since git 2.8 (March 2016), you can avoid that double entry for a tag, and list directly those dereferenced tags with:
```
git ls-remote --ref
```
It can also help resolve the actual url used by a remote repo when you have "url.<base>.insteadOf" config setting.
If git remote --get-url <aremotename> returns https://server.com/user/repo, and you have set git config
url.ssh://git@server.com:.insteadOf https://server.com/:
```
git ls-remote --get-url <aremotename>
ssh://git@server.com:user/repo
```
## 3.7: Adding a New Remote Repository
```
git remote add upstream git-repository-url
```
Adds remote git repository represented by git-repository-url as new remote named upstream to the git repository

## 3.8: Set Upstream on a New Branch
You can create a new branch and switch to it using
``` 
git checkout -b AP-57
```
After you use git checkout to create a new branch, you will need to set that upstream origin to push to using
```
git push --set-upstream origin AP-57
```
After that, you can use git push while you are on that branch.

## 3.9: Getting Started
Syntax for pushing to a remote branch
```
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```
Example
```
git push origin master
```

## 3.10: Renaming a Remote
To rename remote, use command git remote rename
The git remote rename command takes two arguments:
 * An existing remote name, for example : origin
 * A new name for the remote, for example : destination
Get existing remote name
```
git remote
# origin
```
Check existing remote with URL
```
git remote -v
# origin https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
# origin https://github.com/usernam/repo.git (push)
```
Rename remote
```
git remote rename origin destination
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'destination'
```
Verify new name
```
git remote -v
# destination https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
# destination https://github.com/usernam/repo.git (push)
```
=== Posible Errors ===
1. Could not rename config section 'remote.[old name]' to 'remote.[new name]'
This error means that the remote you tried the old remote name (origin) doesn't exist.
2. Remote [new name] already exists.
Error message is self explanatory.

## 3.11: Show information about a Specific Remote
Output some information about a known remote: origin
```
git remote show origin
```
Print just the remote's URL:
```
git config --get remote.origin.url
```
With 2.7+, it is also possible to do, which is arguably better than the above one that uses the config command.
```
git remote get-url origin
```

## 3.12: Set the URL for a Specific Remote
You can change the url of an existing remote by the command
```
git remote set-url remote-name url
```

## 3.13: Get the URL for a Specific Remote
You can obtain the url for an existing remote by using the command
```
git remote get-url <name>
```
By default, this will be
```
git remote get-url origin
```

## 3.14: Changing a Remote Repository
To change the URL of the repository you want your remote to point to, you can use the set-url option, like so:
```
git remote set-url <remote_name> <remote_repository_url>
```
Example:
```
git remote set-url heroku https://git.herok
```




# 4: Staging
## 4.1: Staging All Changes to Files
```
git add -A
```
Version â‰¥ 2.0
```
git add .
```
In version 2.x, git add . will stage all changes to files in the current directory and all its subdirectories. However, in
1.x it will only stage new and modified files, not deleted files.
Use git add -A, or its equivalent command git add --all, to stage all changes to files in any version of git.

## 4.2: Unstage a file that contains changes
```
git reset <filePath>
```
To create a new branch (locally):
* With the commit hash (or part of it)
```
git checkout -b new_branch 6e559cb
```
* or to go back 4 commits from HEAD
```
git checkout -b new_branch HEAD~4
```

## 4.3: Add changes by hunk
You can see what "hunks" of work would be staged for commit using the patch flag:
```
git add -p
```
or
```
git add --patch
```
This opens an interactive prompt that allows you to look at the diffs and let you decide whether you want to include them or not.
Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]?
- y stage this hunk for the next commit
- n do not stage this hunk for the next commit
- q quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
- a stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
- d do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
- g select a hunk to go to
- / search for a hunk matching the given regex
- j leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
- J leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
- k leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
- K leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
- s split the current hunk into smaller hunks
- e manually edit the current hunk
- ? print hunk help
This makes it easy to catch changes which you do not want to commit.
You can also open this via git add --interactive and selecting p.

```
## 4.4: Interactive add
```
git add -i (or --interactive) 
```
will give you an interactive interface where you can edit the index, to prepare what
you want to have in the next commit. You can add and remove changes to whole files, add untracked files and
remove files from being tracked, but also select subsection of changes to put in the index, by selecting chunks of
changes to be added, splitting those chunks, or even editing the diff. Many graphical commit tools for Git (like e.g.
git gui) include such feature; this might be easier to use than the command line version.
It is very useful (1) if you have entangled changes in the working directory that you want to put in separate commits,
and not all in one single commit (2) if you are in the middle of an interactive rebase and want to split too large
commit.
```
$ git add -i
staged unstaged path
1: unchanged +4/-4 index.js
2: +1/-0 nothing package.json
*** Commands ***
1: status 2: update 3: revert 4: add untracked
5: patch 6: diff 7: quit 8: help
What now>
```
The top half of this output shows the current state of the index broken up into staged and unstaged columns:
1. index.js has had 4 lines added and 4 lines removed. It is currently not staged, as the current status reports "unchanged." When this file becomes staged, the +4/-4 bit will be transferred to the staged column and the unstaged column will read "nothing."
2. package.json has had one line added and has been staged. There are no further changes since it has been staged as indicated by the "nothing" line under the unstaged column. The bottom half shows what you can do. Either enter a number (1-8) or a letter (s, u, r, a, p, d, q, h).
status shows output identical to the top part of the output above.
update allows you to make further changes to the staged commits with additional syntax.
revert will revert the staged commit information back to HEAD.
add untracked allows you to add filepaths previously untracked by version control.
patch allows for one path to be selected out of an output similar to status for further analysis.
diff displays what will be committed.
quit exits the command.
help presents further help on using this command.

## 4.5: Show Staged Changes
To display the hunks that are staged for commit:
```
git diff --cached
```

## 4.6: Staging A Single File
To stage a file for committing, run
```
git add <filename>
```

## 4.7: Stage deleted files
```
git rm filename
```
To delete the file from git without removing it from disk, use the --cached flag
```
git rm --cached filename
```
